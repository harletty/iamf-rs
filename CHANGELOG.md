# Changelog

## Unreleased

Expanded loudspeaker layouts (`loudspeaker_layout` 15), all twenty:

- `iamf-dec`: `layout::expanded_info` — 9.1.6, 10.2.9.3 and 7.1.5.4 as
  whole layouts, and the subsets of 5.1.4, 7.1.4, 9.1.6, 10.2.9.3 and
  7.1.5.4 (LFE, LFE pair, stereo pairs, Top-1/4/5/6ch, Bottom-3/4ch,
  3.0ch). A subset carries only its own channels and renders through its
  reference layout's matrices restricted to their rows
  (`Reconstructed::Channels::rows`, OAR's custom-layout channel map), so
  no silent planes are built or mixed. Replaces the LFE-only special case.
- `matrices.rs` is now generated from the Open Audio Renderer's EAR
  tables (`tools/extract_matrices.py`), which carry libiamf v1.1's
  unchanged (all 165 m2m and 75 h2m matrices compared equal) plus the
  10.2.9.3 and 7.1.5.4 inputs and the 7.1.5.4 output:
  `MatrixLayout::Iamf7154` and `Iamf10293`.
- Mix selection without object passthrough excludes the mixes that
  contain object-based elements, instead of every v2.0-profile mix: a
  v2.0 stream of channel-based elements (7.1.5.4, 10.2.9.3) now decodes
  by default. Reserved expanded layouts (20+) are outside every profile.
- Elements in an expanded layout take the stereo matrices on headphones:
  the binaural renderer has no virtual speakers for them yet.
- Checked against all 86 libiamf vectors using expanded layouts: every
  reference layout of the channel- and scene-based ones within 1–2 LSB,
  batch and streaming (the vectors with object elements and the 7.1.5.4
  output layout are out of reach). Tests: five of them in
  `tools/iamfdec/tests/render.rs` (added to `fetch_vectors.sh`), one in
  `stream.rs`, plus unit tests (subset rendering equals the reference
  layout rendered with the other channels silent, for every subset and
  output).

IAMF v2.0 object-based audio elements, handed out rather than rendered:

- `iamf-obu`: `AudioElementConfig::ObjectBased` (`ObjectsConfig`); the
  v2.0 `rendering_config` fields a v1.1 parser skipped are now parsed:
  `binaural_filter_profile`, position parameter definitions
  (`PositionParam`: polar, cart8, cart16 and their dual forms) and
  `ElementGainOffset`, on `SubMixElement`; `BitReader` for their
  bit-packed coordinates.
- `iamf-dec`: profiles base-advanced, advanced-1 and advanced-2
  (`ProfileSet::BASE_ADVANCED` .. `ADVANCED_2`, `V1`, `V2_OBJECTS`) in mix
  filtering (objects only in v2 profiles, object-only mixes for
  base-advanced, 18/28 element and channel budgets, head-locked binaural
  allowed in v2); position parameter blocks (`position` module: step,
  linear, Bezier, inter-linear, inter-Bezier; polar linear animations
  along the great circle; defaults across gaps).
- `StreamSettings::object_passthrough`: object elements' PCM (after the
  element and output mix gains, the element gain offset and trimming) and
  their positions per temporal unit come out of
  `StreamDecoder::take_objects`, while the other elements of the mix are
  rendered as before. Without it, mixes containing objects are not
  selectable (rendering them, per the Open Audio Renderer, is not
  implemented), so v1.1 behavior and output are unchanged.
- The element gain offset is applied to rendered elements too.
- Tests: `tools/iamfdec/tests/objects.rs` on the libiamf object vectors
  (added to `fetch_vectors.sh`): object PCM equals the LPCM source through
  the declared gains sample for sample; polar, cartesian and dual
  trajectories follow the vectors' parameter blocks and defaults.

Modernization and cleanup pass (no decoding behavior changes; the
conformance suite is byte-identical).

- Semver hygiene: `#[non_exhaustive]` on the public enums and settings
  structs; `channels`/`demixer`/`matrices` are crate-private (with
  `MatrixLayout`/`HoaOrder` re-exported); settings are built via
  `Default` + field assignment.
- Hot-path allocation pass: the demixer borrows prerequisite planes and
  moves outputs (was ~14 plane copies per 7.1.4 frame), the streaming
  decoder parses OBUs without per-payload copies, parameter handling
  clones nothing, mix-gain evaluation caches linear endpoints (no
  per-sample `powf`), the limiter runs in place, and the binaural FFT
  reuses scratch.
- Fixed: NaN from zero-duration bezier subblocks; ambisonics order
  underflow on empty input; `channels == 0` panic in the FLAC adapter;
  `iamfplay`'s quantizer rounding divergence; `iamfplay` no longer
  deep-copies the decoded PCM per stream rebuild.
- Dedup: shared quantizers, trim ranges, param-index builder, Opus
  adapter plumbing; dead items removed (`Bs2051M`, unused frame-size
  plumbing, `is_first_substream`).
- Lints: workspace-wide `clippy::pedantic` subset, `unreachable_pub`,
  `missing_debug_implementations`, `rust_2018_idioms`; the FFI crates
  re-declare `undocumented_unsafe_blocks` (every unsafe block now has a
  SAFETY comment); `missing_docs` enforced across all library crates
  (`iamf-obu`, `iamf-dec`, `iamf-codecs`, `iamf-capi`).
- Tooling: CI gains MSRV (1.85), docs-with-warnings-denied, and fuzz
  fmt/clippy jobs; `Cargo.lock` is committed; crates.io metadata
  (keywords, categories, readme, docs.rs config) added; a test pins the
  C header constants to the Rust definitions.
- CLI polish: `iamfdec` rejects unknown flags and parses args linearly;
  `iamfplay` prints `Display` errors.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-08-25

Spec-conformance and Chromium-integration hardening. The C ABI settings
struct gained fields and a function, hence the minor bump.

- **Profile validation** (new `iamf_dec::profile`): a port of iamf-tools'
  `ProfileFilter`. `StreamSettings::requested_profiles` /
  `iamfrs_settings.requested_profiles` are enforced — the sequence
  header's declared profiles must intersect the requested set, and mix
  selection only considers presentations within some requested profile's
  limits (sub-mix count, headphone rendering modes, element types and
  layouts, expanded-layout variants, element/channel budgets, and the
  one-codec-config / uniform frame-size-and-rate rules). The Chromium
  adapter now forwards `Settings::requested_profile_versions`.
- **Loudness normalization and peak limiting in the streaming decoder
  and C ABI** (`loudness_target_db`, `enable_limiter`), not just the
  CLI. Both default off, matching the iamf-tools decoder that Chromium
  ships (libiamf, by contrast, limits at -1 dBFS by default).
- **Subblock-granular parameter timelines** (`params::ParamCursor`):
  demixing and recon-gain parameter blocks whose subblocks span several
  temporal units now apply each subblock to the units it covers, in both
  drivers; previously only the first subblock was used. Durations follow
  libiamf's `(rate + 0.1) / parameter_rate` scaling.
- **Parameter-ID multimap**: a parameter id consumed by several
  definitions (invalid per spec, but previously last-writer-wins) now
  reaches every consumer; the output-mix-gain entry can no longer
  clobber an element parameter.
- **Temporal-unit assembly robustness**: temporal delimiter OBUs are
  checked for unit alignment (a mid-unit delimiter is a
  `CorruptPacket`); frames of one unit must agree on trimming (§3.9) and
  on frame length across elements; parameter application no longer
  assumes the first substream's frame arrives first.
- **`reset_with_new_mix`** (`iamfrs_decoder_reset_with_new_mix`,
  iamf-tools `ResetWithNewMix`): in-place mix/layout switching that
  reuses (and resets) the codec decoders of retained audio elements
  instead of rebuilding the decoder from scratch; the Chromium adapter
  uses it and no longer retains a descriptor copy.
- **Mix selection by id now falls back to automatic selection** when the
  id is absent or unsupported, matching iamf-tools' documented
  `RequestedMix` semantics (previously an error).
- Ported/verified against upstream: libiamf PR #176 (limiter default
  threshold: rename only, value unchanged at -1 dBFS) and PR #168
  (`rendering_config` parsing — not applicable, iamf-rs skips the sized
  extension region); iamf-tools' August 2026 allocation caps are covered
  by existing bounded parsing.
- Tests: ambisonics PROJECTION coverage (unit tests plus conformance
  vectors 000042/000048, new in the curated fetch set); invalid vectors
  000007/000025 asserted rejected (including new Opus version
  validation); sound systems E–H and 9.1.6 render sanity; FLAC/AAC
  adapter tests; pure-Rust vs libopus Opus equivalence (>60 dB SNR);
  synthetic-stream tests for spanning parameter blocks, delimiter
  alignment, trim mismatches, and duplicate parameter ids. Vector-driven
  tests now fail with fetch instructions when vectors are missing
  (`IAMF_VECTORS_OPTIONAL=1` restores skip-with-message).
- Docs: corrected stale notes (binaural status, batch-driver mix gains,
  projection matrix Q-format, milestones).

## 0.1.1 — 2026-08-25

- `tools/iamfplay`: terminal demo player — live playback of `.iamf` and
  IAMF-in-MP4 (built-in minimal ISO-BMFF demuxer), instant sample-aligned
  stereo ⇄ binaural toggle, channel-bed meters, mix cycling, and a
  generated third-order-ambisonics demo scene (`--demo`).
- `tools/fetch_vectors.sh --demo` fetches real produced content from the
  iamf-tools web demo.
- New public API: `iamf_dec::binaural::sh_coeffs`; new C API getter
  `iamfrs_decoder_get_selected_layout`.
- Corrected README performance claims: the pure-Rust `opus-decoder`
  fallback is far below realtime on production content (its transforms
  are naive DFTs, issue #5); the published numbers use `opus-ffi`.
- Rust edition 2024 (MSRV stays 1.85); FFI unsafety is now explicit via
  `unsafe extern` and `#[unsafe(no_mangle)]`.
- Docs: demo section, SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CI badge;
  `extract_matrices.py` takes the libiamf path as an argument.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-24

Initial release: a pure-Rust IAMF (Eclipsa Audio) v1.1 decoder.

- OBU parsing, descriptors, parameter blocks (mix gain, demixing,
  recon gain), temporal units, partial-OBU streaming input.
- Codecs: LPCM, Opus (pure-Rust or libopus via `opus-ffi`), FLAC,
  AAC-LC; pluggable `CodecFactory` for integrator-supplied codecs.
- Scalable-channel reconstruction (demixing, recon gain), gain-matrix
  rendering to sound systems A–H plus IAMF extensions, mono, and
  binaural (native port of google/obr's SH-HRIR renderer).
- Mix selection by id or layout, loudness normalization, limiter,
  start/end trimming, Android/WAVE channel reordering.
- `StreamDecoder` streaming API, C ABI (`iamf-capi`), and a reference
  C++ adapter implementing the iamf-tools decoder interface for
  Chromium (`examples/chromium/`).
- Validated against the libiamf conformance vectors (bit-exact on
  lossless paths); fuzzed (`parse_obu`, `decode_stream`); benchmarked
  faster than libiamf and iamf-tools on all measured vectors.
