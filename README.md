A pure-Rust decoder for [IAMF](https://aomediacodec.github.io/iamf/) (Immersive
Audio Model and Formats / Eclipsa Audio), structured after the pipeline of the
[libiamf](https://github.com/AOMediaCodec/libiamf) reference decoder:

```
OBU parser → codec decoders → element reconstructor → renderer → mixer → post-processor
```

## Features

- IAMF v1.1 simple & base profile decoding: OBUs, descriptors, parameter blocks
- IAMF v2.0 object-based elements (base-advanced, advanced-1, advanced-2
  profiles), handed out rather than rendered (`object_passthrough`): each
  object's PCM and its position (polar or cartesian, all five animation
  types) per temporal unit, alongside the rendered non-object elements
- Profile validation with iamf-tools `ProfileFilter` semantics: requested
  profile sets, sequence-header checks, per-mix capability limits
- Codecs: Opus (pure-Rust, or libopus via `opus-ffi`), LPCM, FLAC, AAC-LC
- Scalable channel audio: demixing, recon gains, output gain, layer selection
- Ambisonics, mono and projection modes, orders 1–4
- Rendering to all 14 loudspeaker sound systems (the Open Audio Renderer's
  EAR gain matrices: libiamf v1.1's, plus the IAMF v2.0 layouts)
- Expanded loudspeaker layouts 0–19 (base-enhanced and v2.0 profiles):
  9.1.6, 10.2.9.3 and 7.1.5.4 whole, and their subsets (LFE, stereo pairs,
  top/bottom groups, 3.0) through their reference layout's matrices
- Binaural rendering for headphones — native port of [google/obr](https://github.com/google/obr) (layout 14), any supported sample rate
- Animated mix gains (step/linear/bezier); demixing/recon-gain parameter
  timelines at subblock granularity (blocks may span temporal units)
- Optional loudness normalization and peak limiter (off by default,
  matching the iamf-tools decoder), in both drivers and the C ABI
- Batch and streaming decoders (partial-OBU input, reset/seek), byte-identical outputs
- Mix presentation selection: automatic by layout, by id, or by index;
  in-place mix/layout switching (`reset_with_new_mix`) that reuses codec state
- Output options matching iamf-tools: channel ordering (IAMF or Android/WAVE), auto or explicit s16le/s32le, trimming control, selected-mix query
- C ABI (`iamf-capi`) shaped after the iamf-tools API Chromium consumes
- Bitstream consistency checks: temporal-delimiter alignment, per-unit
  trim agreement, one codec config / frame size per mix
- `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` outside the FFI boundary; parser and full stream decoder fuzzed (CI smoke + local corpus)

Not yet supported: 7.1.5.4 as an output layout, HRTF binaural rendering
of expanded layouts (they take the stereo matrices), output-rate resampling,
rendering object-based elements (the Open Audio Renderer: objects are only
available through `object_passthrough`), and v2.0 mixes using two codec
configs.
Multi-sub-mix presentations are rejected as invalid, matching the v1.1
spec (`num_sub_mixes` must be 1) and libiamf.

## Demo

Put on headphones and run the terminal player:

```sh
cargo run --release -p iamfplay -- --demo
```

`--demo` plays a generated third-order ambisonics scene — a bee orbiting
your head with pings from fixed directions. Press `b` to flip between
plain stereo and HRTF binaural mid-stream — the switch is a
sample-aligned crossfade, so listen for the scene moving out of your
head. Space pauses, `←`/`→` seek, `q` quits. The meters show the
12-channel bed being folded into the 2 channels you hear.

For real produced content (from the iamf-tools web demo):

```sh
tools/fetch_vectors.sh --demo
cargo run --release -p iamfplay -- tests/demo/Animated_demo_3OA_and_2_0.iamf
```

The player also accepts IAMF-in-MP4 files. (`7_1_4_Flac.iamf` in the
same set is a one-speaker-at-a-time channel check — educational, but not
much of a binaural showcase.)

Building `iamfplay` needs libopus (`brew install opus` /
`apt install libopus-dev libasound2-dev`); pass `--no-default-features`
to use the pure-Rust Opus decoder instead (slow, see issue #5).

## Status (August 2026)

Conformance: outputs are checked against the libiamf test-vector suite and
against libiamf's and iamf-tools' own binaries — same-layout renders and
lossless paths are bit-exact, everything else lands within a few LSB, and
binaural matches obr within 2 LSB. Where the reference implementations
disagree with each other, we match iamf-tools (what Chromium ships) and
file it (issues #3, #4).

Performance (Apple M-series, `cargo bench` / `tools/bench_compare.py`):
faster than libiamf v1.1 on every measured path and 4–7× faster than
iamf-tools' decoder, with the `opus-ffi` (libopus) codec path (1.6×
faster than libiamf on Opus). The pure-Rust `opus-decoder` fallback is
currently much slower on real content — its transforms are naive DFTs
(issue #5) — so builds that care about Opus throughput should enable
`opus-ffi`.

## Crates

| Crate | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `iamf-obu` | OBU framing and descriptor parsing of untrusted input. `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, fuzzed, no dependencies. |
| `iamf-dec` | Pipeline stages: reconstruction, rendering, mixing, loudness/limiting, plus the batch and streaming decoders. Codec layer is pluggable via the `SubstreamDecoder` / `CodecFactory` traits. |
| `iamf-codecs` | Feature-gated `SubstreamDecoder` implementations: LPCM, Opus (pure-Rust [opus-decoder](https://crates.io/crates/opus-decoder), or libopus via the `opus-ffi` feature), FLAC and AAC-LC (symphonia). |
| `iamf-capi` | C ABI (`libiamf_rs` cdylib/staticlib + `include/iamf_rs.h`) over the streaming decoder. |
| `tools/iamfdec` | CLI: inspect and decode/render standalone `.iamf` files to WAV. |
| `tools/iamfplay` | Terminal player: live playback (`.iamf` or IAMF-in-MP4) with instant stereo ⇄ binaural toggle, channel meters, and a generated 3OA demo scene (`--demo`). Headphones recommended. |
| `fuzz` | cargo-fuzz targets for the parser. |

## Cargo features

Defaults include everything pure-Rust: all codecs (`pcm`, `opus`,
`flac`, `aac`) and `binaural`. The one opt-in is `opus-ffi`, which
decodes Opus through an external libopus (system or embedder-provided,
e.g. Chromium's `third_party/opus`) — much faster than the pure-Rust
path today (issue #5) and preferred by `DefaultFactory` when enabled.

Embedders trim with `default-features = false` plus an explicit list.
The Chromium-shaped build:

```sh
cargo build -p iamf-capi --no-default-features --features pcm,opus-ffi
```

resolves to only this repository's crates — no external Rust
dependencies to vendor. Dropping `binaural` also drops the FFT stack and
~1.8 MB of embedded HRIR filters; binaural output then falls back to
stereo. CI checks these combinations.

## Scope

Everything the pipeline needs for IAMF v1.1 simple/base(-enhanced-aware)
playback is implemented: OBU/descriptor parsing, all four codecs,
scalable-channel reconstruction, ambisonics (mono + projection),
rendering to every sound system, HRTF binaural (obr port), profile
validation, and the streaming decoder + C ABI Chromium-shaped surface.
ISO-BMFF demuxing is deliberately out of scope for the library
(Chromium's demuxer delivers descriptors and temporal units; `iamfplay`
carries its own minimal MP4 reader). Remaining gaps and the full history
live in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Development

```sh
cargo test                      # unit + conformance tests
cargo bench -p iamfdec          # criterion decode benchmarks
cargo clippy --all-targets      # lints (unsafe code is forbidden outside iamf-capi)
cargo +nightly fuzz run parse_obu
cargo run -p iamfdec -- file.iamf
```

Conformance vectors go in `tests/vectors/` (git-ignored); populate with
`tools/fetch_vectors.sh` (curated set), `tools/fetch_vectors.sh --all`, or
specific names. `cargo test` and `cargo bench` pick them up automatically
when present.
